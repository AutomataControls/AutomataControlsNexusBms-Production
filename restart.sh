# Neural BMS Complete System Restart Script - Multi-Location HVAC Control
# ===============================================================================
#
# Author: Juelz NeuralBms DevOps
# Last Updated: June 5, 2025
# Version: 6.0.0 (6-Location Smart Queue Architecture)
# Environment: Production Neural BMS HVAC Control System
# Dependencies: Node.js, PM2, Redis, InfluxDB, BullMQ
#
# PURPOSE:
# Comprehensive nuclear restart script for the Neural HVAC Building Management System
# that orchestrates a complete system shutdown, cache clearing, fresh rebuild, and
# intelligent startup sequence across all 6 smart queue locations. This script ensures
# optimal performance by clearing all cached data and restarting services in the
# correct dependency order for maximum system reliability and performance.
#
# SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
# The Neural BMS system consists of multiple location processors that manage HVAC
# equipment across different facilities using a smart queue architecture with BullMQ
# for high-performance, intelligent processing decisions. Each location operates
# independently with its own processor and factory worker, ensuring fault isolation
# and optimal performance scaling.
#
# COMPREHENSIVE FEATURES:
# ‚úÖ Complete Process Cleanup: Gracefully stops all PM2 processes and kills daemon
# ‚úÖ Redis Cache Clearing: Flushes all BullMQ job data and queue state
# ‚úÖ Cache Purging: Removes all Next.js, Webpack, Babel, and TypeScript build caches
# ‚úÖ Fresh Application Build: Compiles entire Next.js application from scratch
# ‚úÖ Intelligent Startup Sequence: Starts services in optimal dependency order
# ‚úÖ Error Handling: Comprehensive error detection and graceful degradation
# ‚úÖ Timing Controls: Strategic delays ensure processes fully stop/start
# ‚úÖ Status Monitoring: Real-time feedback on each startup phase
# ‚úÖ Performance Validation: Verifies successful startup of all critical services
# ‚úÖ Dashboard Integration: Provides direct links to monitoring interfaces
#
# SMART QUEUE ARCHITECTURE:
# Each location uses an advanced smart queue system with the following features:
# - BullMQ Integration: High-performance job queuing with Redis backend
# - Intelligent Processing: UI commands, safety checks, deviation detection
# - Priority Management: Safety > UI > Deviation > Maintenance processing order
# - Timeout Protection: Automatic cleanup of stuck jobs and processes
# - Performance Optimization: 1-2 second processing speeds across all equipment
# - Factory Workers: Dedicated workers for equipment logic execution
# - State Management: Persistent state storage between processing cycles
#
# DETAILED STARTUP SEQUENCE:
# The startup order is carefully designed to ensure optimal system performance
# and prevent race conditions between interdependent services:

#    ‚Ä¢ API Services: RESTful endpoints for system integration
#    ‚Ä¢ Database Connections: InfluxDB integration for metrics and commands
#    ‚Ä¢ Web Server: Production-grade HTTPS server with SSL termination
#
# CACHE CLEARING STRATEGY:
# The script performs comprehensive cache clearing to ensure fresh builds:
# - Redis Queue Data: Flushes all BullMQ job queues and processing state
# - Next.js Build Cache: Removes .next directory and cached build artifacts
# - Node.js Module Cache: Clears node_modules/.cache for all build tools
# - Webpack Cache: Removes webpack-specific caching and optimization data
# - Babel Cache: Clears transpilation cache for consistent JavaScript builds
# - TypeScript Cache: Removes .tsbuildinfo files for clean type checking
#
# ERROR HANDLING AND RECOVERY:
# - Graceful Degradation: Continues startup even if individual services fail
# - Process Validation: Verifies successful startup of each critical component
# - Timeout Protection: Prevents indefinite hangs during startup sequence
# - Detailed Logging: Comprehensive status reporting for troubleshooting
# - Recovery Procedures: Clear instructions for manual intervention if needed
#
# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
# - Sequential Startup: Prevents resource contention during initialization
# - Strategic Delays: Allows services to fully initialize before dependency startup
# - Process Isolation: Each location operates independently for fault tolerance
# - Resource Management: Optimal CPU and memory usage during startup sequence
#
# MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY:
# - Real-time Status: Live feedback during each startup phase
# - Log Aggregation: Centralized logging for all location processors
# - Performance Metrics: 1-2 second processing speed validation
# - Health Checks: Automatic verification of service availability
# - Dashboard Access: Direct links to monitoring and control interfaces
#
# MAINTENANCE AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - Service Status: pm2 status command for comprehensive process overview
# - Individual Logs: Separate log monitoring for each location processor
# - Performance Validation: Expected processing speeds and queue performance
# - Common Issues: Known problems and their resolution procedures
# - Emergency Procedures: Manual intervention steps for critical failures
#
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
# - Process Isolation: Each location runs in separate PM2 processes
# - Resource Limits: Memory and CPU constraints prevent resource exhaustion
# - Access Control: Proper file permissions and execution privileges
# - Network Security: Secure communication between services and databases
#
# BACKUP AND RECOVERY:
# - Configuration Backup: All config files are versioned and backed up
# - Process State: PM2 maintains process state and automatic restarts
# - Data Integrity: InfluxDB and Redis provide data persistence and recovery
# - Rollback Procedures: Quick rollback to previous stable configuration
